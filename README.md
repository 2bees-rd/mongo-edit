Mongo Edit
=========

Dead simple Graphical User Interface for MongoDB.
This is NOT a complete admin UI, just a way to edit documents manually with a user-friendly interface. It's a perfect fit for people working with an ODM, for example <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose" target="_blank">Mongoose</a> which is in charge of the administration.

## What does it do?
* `/` shows the list of all collections
* `/:collection` shows the contents of `collection`
* `/:collection/:id/edit` shows a web-based editor (<a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace" target="_blank">Ace</a>) so that you can change the contents of the `collection`'s document with id `id`. The document is shown as a Javascript object that will replace the current one in the database when you save it. The editor features syntax highlighting and checking. An image being worth a thousands words, here is a screenshot:

## Install and configure
Prerequisite: <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node" target="_blank"><b>Node.js</b></a> should be installed  
Install Mongo Edit in one command: `npm install mongo-edit`  

The config file, `/lib/config.js` needs to be modified to fit your situation. The parameters are:  
* `db.host`, `db.port`, `db.name`: what database to connect to. It is assumed that you run in a trusted environment and don't need password to access the database (this should be the case for all developpement machines and most production machines with a restrictive firewall).
* `svPort`: the port on which the webserver will run.
* `trustProxy`: needs to be set to `true` if Mongo Edit is run behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. If you run Mongo Edit in production and it is accessible from the outside, **this should be the case**. Obviously, it should be protected by a BasicAuth over SSL.
* `pagination`: the parameters for the pagination when showing the contents of a collection. The defaults should be fine.

You can define different environments (the original config file has 'development' and 'production'). By default, the development environment is used, to user another run `NODE_ENV=the_environment node server.js`.

## Run
Run with `node server.js`, or `NODE_ENV=env node server.js` if you don't want to use the default environment. It will then run on the port defined in the config (e.g. with the original config and on my development machine, it runs on `localhost:2762`).  

If you run Mongo Edit in production, **run it behind your reverse proxy, and protected with a Basic Auth on SSL**.


## Feature requests
We want Mongo Edit to remain super simple, there are already plenty complete admin UIs out there. Still, if you think something is missing don't hesitate to drop us an issue or a PR.
